Overfitting is a problem where the model learns the noise or irrelevant patterns in the training data and performs poorly on new or unseen data. Regularization helps to avoid overfitting by shrinking the coefficients of the features or setting some of them to zero, which reduces the variance of the model and improves its generalization ability.\n",

Ridge, on the other hand, tends to **shrink** all coefficients by the same amount, resulting in a **dense** model that includes all features.

One trade-off is the choice of the **regularization parameter**, which controls the strength of the penalty. A higher parameter means more regularization, but also more bias and less variance. A lower parameter means less regularization, but also less bias and more variance. The optimal parameter depends on the data and the model performance, and can be found using techniques like cross-validation. One limitation is that both Ridge and Lasso assume that the features are **linearly related** to the outcome, and may not perform well on non-linear data. Another limitation is that both Ridge and Lasso may not be suitable for **highly correlated** features, as they may produce unstable or inconsistent results."
