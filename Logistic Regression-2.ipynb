Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions, which measures the overall performance of the model. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which balances both aspects of the model. Roc-auc is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate for different thresholds, which measures the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Precision-recall is the plot of precision against recall for different thresholds, which measures the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity."
